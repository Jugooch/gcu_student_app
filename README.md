# Grand Canyon University Student App

## Justice Gooch - Senior Capstone

This Application is a redesign of Grand Canyon University's (GCU's) mobile student application. The point of this redesign was to condense the amount of applications that GCU students have to download. As of right now, students download upwards of 8 to 9 applications to do various GCU-related tasks; this app shrinks that down to 1. It utilizes Flutter as a frontend framework to support use across different platforms and is designed based on an entire UI/UX case study done on current GCU students.
